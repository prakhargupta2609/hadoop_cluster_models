# hadoop_cluster_models


#Project to automate the formation of a highly efficient cluster for Big Data using Hadoop
Framework on a bunch of computers by just one click to reduce the work of configuring
each system individually and to manage the cluster efficiently .Three options will be
provided-:

1. Automatic Formation: Under this, the software automatically detects which system is
suitable for which job in the cluster and makes the cluster accordingly.

2. User Customized: Under this, the software shows the list of nodes connected to the
system and their specifications. The software then makes the cluster by assigning jobs
to the systems according to the user's wish.

3. Docker Implemented Cluster: Under this, the software provides as many nodes as
asked by the user and forms the Hadoop cluster with them.This will lead to a very
optimal use of resources in the cluster. This will be achieved by using Docker Containers.
